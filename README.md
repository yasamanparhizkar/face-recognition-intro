# face-recognition-intro
An introduction to image processing and deep learning in MATLAB

## Description:
This project explores a few examples of image processing:
1. Spatial domain filtering with kernels.
2. Image enlargement followed by interpolation and filtering.
3. Distinguishing the outline of a piece of paper in an image by means of spatial filtering.
4. Introduction to two dimentional fourier transform and frequency domain filtering of images.
5. Face recognition by means of a one-layer neural network. The data used in this section is acquired from the [AT&T Database of Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces/).  
	5-1. Compressing inputs with an autoencoder.  
	5-2. Training a one-layer neural network with one-hot targets.  
	5-3. Stacking the neural network on top of the autoencoder to create the final system.  
	5-4. Test the accuracy of the system (It yields a 93.75% accuracy rate).
